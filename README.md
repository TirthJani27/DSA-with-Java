Welcome to my personal repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using _Java_. This repository serves as a collection of my daily coding exercises, solutions, and projects to solidify my understanding of DSA concepts.

## 📚 About this Repository

In this repository, you'll find:

- _Java implementations_ of various data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- _Algorithms_ covering searching, sorting, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and graph algorithms.
- Regular practice sessions to improve coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## 🚀 Features

- _Daily Commit Practices_: Every day, I solve a new problem or learn a new concept and commit my progress to this repository.
- _Clear Code with Comments_: Each implementation includes detailed comments explaining the code logic.
- _Problem-Solving Approach_: I try to implement multiple approaches to solve the same problem, showcasing different algorithms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- _Programming Language_: Java
- _Libraries_: Any external libraries or tools used (e.g., JUnit for testing) will be mentioned here.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tirth-Jani-22/DSA-with-Java

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   bash
   cd DSA-with-JAVA
3. Browse through the folder structure, where each sub-folder corresponds to a different data structure/algorithm.
4. Open the Java files in any IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) to run the code.

## 📅 Daily Practice

- I am committed to improving my DSA skills one problem at a time! You can check the DailyPractice branch or refer to the commit history for a timeline of my progress.

## 👨‍💻 Contributing
